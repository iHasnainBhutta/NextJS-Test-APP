# SWAPI Application with Next.js

This application utilizes the Star Wars API (SWAPI) to display a list of people and their information. The implementation is done using Next.js, providing a responsive and efficient web experience. The data is paginated, and selecting a person leads to a dedicated page with detailed information. Additionally, specific details such as "homeworld," "species," "starships," and "films" are accessible through modals instead of separate pages.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/iHasnainBhutta/NextJS-Test-App.git
    cd NextJS-Test-App

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4. **Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).**

## Features
